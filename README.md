![image_2024-09-24_02-05-29](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63e8021c-2dc0-4200-9fd7-bb9fa2d1b737)

## Description

This app lets you chat with bots that reply with random quotes from the quotable API (https://api.quotable.io/random).

The app was created using React for the front-end and express.js for the back-end. It uses MongoDB database (running on Atlas). Third-party authentication through Google is implemented using the Passport library. 

## How to Install and Run the Project

1. First, install all the required packages using ```npm install``` (you need to do this separately for both front-end and back-end).
2. Then, run the back-end with ```npm run devStart``` and run the front-end with ```npm start```.
3. Go to http://localhost:3000
4. Done!

   (Before doing the steps above, you need to rename the .env.sample file to .env in the back-end directory and set all the variables in it. Good luck with that üëç )
